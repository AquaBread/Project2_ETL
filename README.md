# Project2_ETL

## ETL Mini Project 2

This project analyzes the extraction, transformation, and load of data frames of crowd funding sources through csv. Our motivation for this project is to extrapolate information of large data sets and formulate it to simple analysis. 

### Team Members:

- Amanda Cantu
- Alexander Chavera
- Brian Paniagua
- Adam Saenz

### Category and Subcategory:

Brian extracted the crowdfunding spreadsheet and made a category ID for both the category and subcategory. 

### Campaign:

Alex utilized the category and subcategory ID’s and integrated it into a new campaign data frame which was exported as campaign csv.

### Contacts:

Adam analyzed a spreadsheet and organized the personal information into a readable data frame which was exported as contacts.csv. 

### Crowdfunding Database:

Amanda analyzed the category and subcategory, campaign and contact csv’s to identify the primary keys and foreign keys to create an ERD. In the postgres database she created tables for all csv files and imported the data.
